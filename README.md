# menu.jsx file Improvements:

We have introduced a new Dropdown component that provide a customizable and reusable selection menu in the src/components/menu.jsx.
This component supports syncing the menu selection to the server using the httpPatch abstraction. 
It can be easily integrated into various use cases such as an Account picker, a searchable list of items, or as a step in configuring Alerting.



# Pull Request Comments/Suggestions:

In the ActiveProfiles component, consider using the const keyword when declaring the active variable since its value is not reassigned. This helps improve code readability and indicates that the variable is intended to be a constant.
Instead of using a traditional for loop to filter active profiles, you can utilize array methods like filter and map to achieve the same result in a more concise and declarative way.
